# RFP - Codewords App

## Background

As a professor, I like to administer anonymous surveys to the students in my course at the beginning and end of the semester.  To improve the quality of the data collected, I would also like to be able to associate the initial and final surveys of a student (while maintaining anonymity.) My low-tech solution is to provide each student before the survey with a slip of paper that has a code word on it.  They enter the code word into the initial survey and mail it to themselves.  They find the email and retrieve their code word before the end survey.  They enter the code word into the end survey.  The anonymity of responses is maintained, and I can associate the initial and end surveys.  There are some problems with this approach.  How do I guarantee that each student gets a code word?  How do we get a random, anonymous distribution of code words? Will students be able to find the email?  I have a list of about 80 code words that are designed to not be unique and dissimilar.  What do I do if there are more than 80 students?  Other professors also administer surveys and this application may also be of use to them. 

## Statement of Purpose

Create an app to randomly distribute code words from a list to the students in a course via the Web.  

## Functional Requirements

There will be a web app with roles for: (1) administrators, (2) professors, (3) students. Students will be able to retrieve their code word for a specific course survey. A Student will be able get repeated access to the code word for a course over an extended period. Professors will be able to set an expiration date (generally the last day of the term). This can default to 4 months from the date of creation. Professors will be able to create a list of code words to be assigned to students in a course. Professors will be able to anonymously assign code words to students. Professors will be able to monitor that students in a class have received a code word, but not be able to determine what the code word is. Professors will be able to use the application to assign code words for concurrent surveys in different courses, and different sections active at the same time. Therefore, students may have multiple code words during a term. 

Administrators will be able to manage all information, including professor surveys, student lists, sets of code words.  Security must be addressed.

## Additional Requirements

The app must work on an iPhone SE.

## Bidder Qualifications

Bidders must be able to:

1. Specify the project I have suggested and review the details with me before beginning.
1. Be able to implement the suggested project within times agreed to in the contract.

## Metrics

Specified in the contract.

## Schedule

* Phase 1: Rapid architecture/data/UI design & project charter competition (2 weeks)
* Phase 2: Synthesis of design (2 weeks)
* Phase 2: Contract completion & delivery (1 week)
* Phase 2: Contract finalization (1 week)
* Phase 3: Implementation, testing, and review of iterative MVPs (~7-8 weeks)
* Phase 4: Final design and implementation plan for next semester (~2 weeks)

## Project Conception and Initialization

Phase 1 will include the development of a detailed Project Charter to be presented in Markdown or HTML with in-line images and tables (not Word). It will include at least the following sections. 

* Overview
* Purpose
* Benefits
* Epics / Stories / Tasks
* Acceptance criteria checklist
* Contract scope / budget / schedule
* User experience sketches
* Stack information 
* E-R diagram 
* Sample data
* Risks and assumptions

## Project Definition and Planning

Phase 2 will include the development of a detailed contract for this semester's remaining work.  
It must be presented in Markdown or HTML with in-line images and tables (not Word).
The contract will specify:

* Overview
* Purpose
* Benefits
* Epics / Stories / Tasks
* Acceptance criteria checklist
* Functional requirements
* Performance requirements (within range of values)
* Other requirements
* User experience sketches
* E-R diagram 
* Sample data
* Stack description (including expected tools, technologies, libraries, more)
* Risks and assumptions
* Deliverable artifacts 
* Scope
* Milestones
* Schedule and Iteration Plan
* Budget
* Test plan with requirements
* Bid amount

## Payment, Incentives, and Containment

If contract requirements are met 1 7-day week ahead of schedule to the satisfaction of the client, students are eligible for a 2.5% bonus (based on the total number of points possible) for the associated deliverable. 

## Terms and Conditions

The application should be Northwest branded yet may be used by people outside the university. All code and applications should be licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. 

## Evaluation Criteria

The client will provide feedback throughout the development process. While the client may ask for a requirement change, if granted it would require a modification of the contract with commensurate elimination of other requirements. This would only be applied it there was a critical change in core functionality.  Typically, requirements changes will be documented and would serve as the basis of a change contract. 

The user interface will be evaluated on aesthetics as well as ability to perform a task.  There will be a single major review of every new interface screen.  Good choices will be made for images/color/sound. Screen space will be used well.  Controls will have signifiers indicating where and how operations/input can occur. Input will be validated. Appropriate feedback will be employed.  The interface will avoid requiring multiple clicks for common operations.  Confirmation is not required if an operation is easy to undo.  Confirmation is required for operations that cannot be undone.  Default values will be provided for fields.  Do not loose what has been typed if there are errors.  This app will be ADA compliant. If specified in the contract, support for internationalization may be required.

Note: Correct functionality is not a requirement change.
